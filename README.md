# Parallel Work for edX Course

I am taking the course [Foundations of Data Science: Computational Thinking with Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+Data8.1x+1T2018/course/) on edX.
Because of copyright reasons I cannot upload my course work, but I will do separate projects that parallel what I learn in the course.
